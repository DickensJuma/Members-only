# Members Only!

## Built With

- Ruby on Rails

## Project Description

In this project, we’ll be building an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.
